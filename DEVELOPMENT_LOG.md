## Success Criteria
- [ ] Next.js app running at localhost:3000 with homepage showing concept explanation
- [ ] Admin interface at localhost:3000/admin with password protection
- [ ] Can create/edit game reviews through admin form with all required fields
- [ ] Public review pages display content with prominent fair price badges
- [ ] Image upload working with preview in admin
- [ ] API endpoints return structured JSON data
- [ ] Minimalist design with clean typography and whitespace

## Technical Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with minimal color palette (grayscale + price tier colors)
- File-based content (JSON files + local image storage)
- No external databases or legacy dependencies

## Content Structure
Store reviews as JSON files in `/content/reviews/[slug].json`:
```typescript
interface GameReview {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  gameTitle: string;
  fairPriceTier: 'Premium' | 'Standard' | 'Budget' | 'Free-to-Play' | 'Wait-for-Sale' | 'Never-Buy' | 'Subscription-Only';
  fairPriceAmount?: number;
  quickVerdict: string; // 300 char limit
  reviewContent: string; // markdown
  featuredImage: string; // filename
  youtubeVideoId?: string;
  publishedAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  pros?: string[];
  cons?: string[];
}
```

## Required Pages
- **Homepage** (`/`): Hero explaining Fair Price Index concept + featured reviews grid
- **Reviews List** (`/reviews`): Clean grid of all reviews with filtering by price tier
- **Individual Review** (`/reviews/[slug]`): Full review with prominent price display, embedded YouTube video, pros/cons
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): Password-protected review management
- **Admin Review Form** (`/admin/reviews/new` & `/admin/reviews/[slug]/edit`): Create/edit interface

## API Routes Needed
- `GET/POST /api/reviews` - list all / create new
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/reviews/[slug]` - single review operations  
- `POST /api/upload` - image upload handler
- `POST /api/auth` - simple password authentication

## Design Requirements
**Minimalist Constraints:**
- Maximum 4 colors total: black, white, gray, plus one accent color per price tier
- Typography: Single font family (Inter), max 3 font sizes
- Components: Clean forms, simple cards, prominent price badges
- Layout: Generous whitespace, single-column mobile, simple grid desktop
- No decorative elements, focus purely on content hierarchy

**Price Tier Colors:**
- Premium: Green (#10b981)
- Standard: Blue (#3b82f6)
- Budget: Yellow (#f59e0b)
- Free-to-Play: Red (#ef4444)
- Other tiers: Appropriate muted colors

## Key Components to Build
1.  **FairPriceBadge** - Prominent price display with tier-based coloring
2.  **ReviewCard** - Minimal card for review listings (image, title, price, verdict excerpt)
3.  **ReviewForm** - Admin form with all review fields, image upload, markdown editor
4.  **YouTubeEmbed** - Simple responsive video embedding
5.  **AdminLayout** - Basic admin wrapper with navigation

## File Operations
- Use Node.js `fs/promises` for JSON file CRUD operations
- Store images in `/public/uploads/` directory
- Generate URL-safe slugs from review titles
- Handle file naming conflicts with timestamps

## Content Management Features
- Simple password protection for admin (store hash in environment variable)
- Image upload with preview and file validation
- Basic markdown support for review content
- Form validation for required fields
- Review list with edit/delete actions

## Error Handling
- Graceful 404 pages for missing reviews
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Image upload error handling
- API error responses with appropriate status codes

## Validation Test
Create one complete review through admin interface:
- Title: "Example Game Review"
- Game: "Test Game 2024"
- Fair Price Tier: "Budget"
- Fair Price Amount: 15
- Quick Verdict: "Decent gameplay held back by technical issues"
- Upload test image
- Add some markdown content with pros/cons

Verify review appears correctly on both admin list and public page with proper styling and price badge.

Build this as a clean, functional website that prioritizes content readability and user experience over visual complexity. Focus on making the fair price concept immediately clear to visitors.
```

## Development Process and Steps Taken

The development process involved setting up the Next.js project, implementing core components, API routes, and pages, and extensive debugging to resolve various issues.

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Attempted to create a Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest . --ts --tailwind --app --src-dir --use-pnpm --no-eslint --no-tests`.
    *   **Issue:** `Error: spawn pnpm ENOENT`.
    *   **Resolution:** Installed `pnpm` globally using `npm install -g pnpm`.
    *   **Issue:** `create-next-app` failed due to existing files from the previous failed attempt.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed conflicting files and directories (`rm -rf README.md next-env.d.ts ...`).
    *   Successfully created the Next.js project.

2.  **Initial Setup & Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
    *   Verified the Next.js app was running at `localhost:3000`.
    *   Created `src/types/game-review.d.ts` for the `GameReview` interface.
    *   **Issue:** `File '...' is not a module`.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `export` to the `GameReview` interface (`export interface GameReview { ... }`).
    *   Created content directories: `content/reviews` and `public/uploads`.
    *   Modified `src/app/layout.tsx` to use `Inter` font instead of `Geist`.
    *   Modified `src/app/page.tsx` with the initial concept explanation.
    *   Modified `src/app/globals.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";` (as per Tailwind CSS v4 docs).
    *   **Issue:** Persistent Tailwind CSS errors (`Cannot apply unknown utility class`, `trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin`). This was a major blocker.
    *   **Debugging & Resolution:**
        *   Checked `tailwind.config.ts` (initially missing, then created).
        *   Checked `postcss.config.mjs`.
        *   Attempted various configurations for `postcss.config.mjs` (object vs. array syntax for plugins, explicit `require`).
        *   Removed `tailwind.config.ts` based on v4 "zero config" docs.
        *   Cleaned `node_modules` and reinstalled dependencies.
        *   **Final Resolution:** The issue was resolved by ensuring `postcss.config.mjs` used the exact object syntax for plugins (`plugins: { "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}, }`) as specified in the Tailwind CSS v4 Next.js installation guide provided by the user. This was a subtle but critical difference from array syntax.

3.  **Core Components Implementation:**
    *   **FairPriceBadge:** Created `src/components/FairPriceBadge.tsx` to display price tiers with custom colors.
    *   **ReviewCard:** Created `src/components/ReviewCard.tsx` for review listings.
    *   **YouTubeEmbed:** Created `src/components/YouTubeEmbed.tsx` for embedding YouTube videos.

4.  **Data Handling & API Routes:**
    *   Created `src/lib/reviews.ts` with `fs/promises` for CRUD operations on JSON review files (`getAllReviews`, `getReviewBySlug`, `saveReview`, `deleteReview`, `generateSlug`).
    *   Implemented `GET` and `POST` for `/api/reviews` in `src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`.
    *   Implemented `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` for `/api/reviews/[slug]` in `src/app/api/reviews/[slug]/route.ts`.
    *   Implemented `POST` for `/api/upload` in `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` for image uploads.

5.  **Authentication:**
    *   Created `.env.local` for `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.
    *   **Issue:** `Cannot find module 'uuid'`.
    *   **Resolution:** Installed `uuid` (`pnpm add uuid @types/uuid`).
    *   Implemented `POST` for `/api/auth` in `src/app/api/auth/route.ts`.
    *   **Issue:** `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` was truncated when loaded via `process.env`, leading to "Invalid credentials".
    *   **Debugging & Resolution:**
        *   Added debug logs to `src/app/api/auth/route.ts` to inspect `process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.
        *   Attempted wrapping the hash in double quotes in `.env.local` (did not resolve).
        *   Attempted changing environment variable name (did not resolve).
        *   **Temporary Workaround:** Modified `src/app/api/auth/route.ts` and `.env.local` to store and compare a plain text password (`ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`) for the purpose of completing the task, bypassing the environment variable loading issue with bcrypt hashes. (Note: In a production environment, a secure hashing method and proper environment variable loading would be critical).

6.  **Page Implementations:**
    *   Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to `.env.local`.
    *   Created `src/app/reviews/page.tsx` for the public reviews list.
    *   Created `src/app/reviews/[slug]/page.tsx` for individual review display.
    *   **Issue:** `params` not awaited in `page.tsx` (Next.js 14 App Router requirement), leading to 404s on dynamic pages.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `src/app/reviews/[slug]/page.tsx` to `const { slug } = await params;`.
    *   **Issue:** Malformed `.json` file (`content/reviews/.json`) causing parsing issues.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed `content/reviews/.json`.
    *   Created `src/components/AdminLayout.tsx`.
    *   Created `src/components/ReviewForm.tsx` for creating/editing reviews.
    *   **Issue:** Input not working in Pros/Cons `textarea` fields (no newlines, spaces, or commas). This was a very persistent and unusual issue.
    *   **Debugging & Resolution:**
        *   Added `resize-y` and `whitespace-pre-wrap` CSS classes (did not resolve).
        *   Replaced `TextareaAutosize` with standard `textarea` and changed input to comma-separated values.
        *   Added extensive debug logs to `handleArrayChange` to trace input.
        *   **Final Resolution:** Refactored Pros/Cons input to use dynamic individual `input` fields with "Add" and "Remove" buttons, completely bypassing the `textarea` input issue. This resolved the problem.
    *   Created `src/app/admin/page.tsx` for the admin dashboard.
    *   Created `src/app/admin/reviews/new/page.tsx` for new review creation.
    *   Created `src/app/admin/reviews/[slug]/edit/page.tsx` for editing existing reviews.

## Important Notes

*   **Tailwind CSS v4:** The integration with Next.js 14 and Turbopack proved challenging due to subtle configuration requirements and potential version mismatches. The official documentation's exact `postcss.config.mjs` structure was crucial.
*   **Environment Variables:** Loading environment variables containing special characters (like `$` in bcrypt hashes) from `.env.local` via `process.env` in Next.js can be problematic. A temporary workaround was implemented for authentication. For a production application, consider more robust environment variable management or alternative authentication strategies.
*   **Pros/Cons Input Issue:** The persistent and unusual input problem with `textarea` elements (affecting even spaces) was likely an environment-specific anomaly (e.g., VS Code's embedded browser, extensions, or system-level input). The solution involved a UI refactor to dynamic individual input fields, which successfully bypassed the issue.
*   **File-based Content:** The application uses `fs/promises` for content management, which is suitable for small projects but would not scale for large numbers of reviews or concurrent writes.

## Improvements and Technical Debt Addressed (Post-Initial Implementation)

Following the initial implementation, several areas for improvement and technical debt were addressed:

1.  **Security:**
    *   Implemented bcrypt password hashing for admin authentication (`src/app/api/auth/route.ts`).
    *   Removed plaintext password storage.
    *   Added security notes to the README.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Improved error handling and validation across API routes (`src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`, `src/app/api/reviews/[slug]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`, `src/app/api/auth/route.ts`).
    *   Added more specific error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
    *   Removed debug `console.log` statements.

3.  **Design & UX:**
    *   Added a featured reviews grid to the homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`).
    *   Simplified the `FairPriceBadge` component to remove redundant tier text when an amount is present (`src/components/FairPriceBadge.tsx`).
    *   Implemented site-wide navigation (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`, integrated into `src/app/layout.tsx`).

4.  **Technical Debt:**
    *   Removed instances of `any` type and improved type safety across the codebase, particularly in API routes and components (`src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`, `src/app/api/reviews/[slug]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`, `src/app/api/auth/route.ts`, `src/components/ReviewForm.tsx`, `src/app/admin/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/reviews/[slug]/edit/page.tsx`).
    *   Implemented logic to delete associated image files when a review is deleted (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`, added `DELETE` endpoint to `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`).

## Environment Variable Loading Issue & Workaround

During development, an issue was encountered where the Next.js development server was not consistently loading the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` environment variable from `.env.local` using standard methods (`process.env`).

*   **Investigation:** Attempted to verify loading with `node -e "console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH)"`, added `@next/env` to `next.config.ts`, and used `dotenv` in the `dev` script in `package.json`. These attempts did not resolve the issue of the variable being `undefined` at runtime.
*   **Workaround:** As a temporary solution, the authentication route (`src/app/api/auth/route.ts`) was modified to directly read and parse the `.env.local` file to retrieve the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`. This successfully enabled authentication.
*   **Note:** This direct file reading is **not recommended for production** and the root cause of the environment variable loading issue in this specific environment should be investigated for a proper long-term fix.
*   **Related Fix:** Resolved an error encountered when running `pnpm dev` after attempting to use `dotenv` in the `dev` script by reverting the script to its original state.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Install dependencies:** `pnpm install`
2.  **Start the development server:** `pnpm dev`
3.  **Access the application:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
4.  **Admin Login:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin` and use the password `admin`.

## Design Polish & User Experience Improvements (Part 2)

This section details the design and user experience enhancements implemented in the second part of the Fair Game Price Index development.

1.  **Site-wide Navigation:**
    *   Created a new `Header` component (`src/components/Header.tsx`) with site title and navigation links (Home, All Reviews).
    *   Created a `Layout` wrapper component (`src/components/Layout.tsx`) to include the `Header` and provide consistent page structure and spacing.
    *   Integrated the `Layout` component into the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) to ensure the header is present on all public pages.

2.  **Fair Price Badge Redesign:**
    *   Refactored the `FairPriceBadge` component (`src/components/FairPriceBadge.tsx`) to display either the monetary amount (for Premium, Standard, Budget tiers) or the tier name (for non-monetary tiers), removing redundancy.
    *   Implemented size variants (sm, md, lg) for the badge.
    *   Ensured consistent use of defined Tailwind color classes for tiers.

3.  **Review Card Improvements:**
    *   Enhanced the `ReviewCard` component (`src/components/ReviewCard.tsx`) with improved image aspect ratio (`aspect-video`), a subtle hover scale effect on the image, refined typography hierarchy, and consistent spacing.
    *   Used the 'sm' size for the `FairPriceBadge` within the review cards.

4.  **Homepage Improvements:**
    *   Redesigned the Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`) to include a more prominent hero section with a clear value proposition and a call-to-action button linking to the All Reviews page.
    *   Updated the featured reviews grid to display up to 6 latest reviews in a responsive 2x3 or 3x2 layout using the enhanced `ReviewCard` component.

5.  **Reviews List Page Enhancements:**
    *   Converted the Reviews List page (`src/app/reviews/page.tsx`) to a client component to manage filtering state.
    *   Implemented fetching of all reviews within a `useEffect` hook.
    *   Added filter buttons for each price tier, allowing users to filter the review list.
    *   Integrated loading, error, and empty states using newly created UI components (`LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`, `EmptyState`).
    *   Improved the grid layout for the review list to a responsive 1, 2, 3, or 4 column layout.

6.  **Individual Review Page Polish:**
    *   Polished the Individual Review Page (`src/app/reviews/[slug]/page.tsx`) with adjusted Tailwind typography classes for headings and body text, refined margins and padding for better spacing, and a "Back to All Reviews" link at the top of the page.
    *   Used the 'lg' size for the `FairPriceBadge` on the individual review page for prominence.
    *   Resolved a TypeScript error related to the back navigation link by using the arrow character (`←`).

7.  **Loading, Error, and Empty State Components:**
    *   Created reusable `LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `ErrorMessage.tsx`, and `EmptyState.tsx` components in `src/components/ui/` to provide visual feedback during data fetching and for empty states.

These changes significantly improve the visual design, navigation, and overall user experience of the public-facing parts of the Fair Game Price Index website, while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic and focusing on content hierarchy.
